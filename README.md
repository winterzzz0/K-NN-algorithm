# Regression K-NN-algorithm
## Implementation of weighted Regression K-NN ( K Nearest Neighbors ) improved by Normalization

### Description
#### This project is about an implementation of the Regression K-NN ( K Nearest Neighbors ) algorithm. It is improved by weighted distance calculations as well as normalization of the feature values to improve the accuracy of the
#### predictions. The algorithm is about predicting the target value for a test given by the user by considering the closest k neighbors in the Data Training.

### Futures are :
#### Weighted K-NN ( Improved regular K-NN )
#### Normalization, to Improve the accuracy of the predications
#### Regression Prediction


### Example in Main function :
#### vector<vector<double>> data = {
####    {3.329020, 396.935231, 2.139362, 66951.489552},
####   {6.962701, 272.208018, 1.147548, 67460.478731},
####    {3.805400, 285.229773, 3.438257, 86297.783944},
####    // ...
#### };
