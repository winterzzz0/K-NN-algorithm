## Implementation of weighted K-NN ( K Nearest Neighbors ) improved by Normalization

### Description
#### This project is about an implementation of the K-NN ( K Nearest Neighbors ) algorithm. It is improved by weighted distance calculations as well as normalization of the feature values to improve the accuracy of the
#### predictions. The algorithm is about predicting the target value for a test given by the user by considering the closest k neighbors in the Data Training.
